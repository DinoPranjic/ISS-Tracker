# ISS Tracker

A fun project created by [Dino Pranjic.](https://github.com/DinoPranjic) ISS Tracker will track the position of the International Space Station and display it on an interactive map for users. It also tracks the current speed, altitude and whether the ISS is in daylight or in the earth's shadow. Users can also change map settings such as adding different layers and zoom in or out.

Built using Typescript and relying on ["Where the ISS at?" REST API](https://wheretheiss.at/w/developer) and [React-Leaflet.](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)
