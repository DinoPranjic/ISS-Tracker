# ISS Tracker

A fun project created by Dino Pranjic. ISS Tracker will track the position of the International Space Station and display it on an interactive map for users. It also tracks the current speed, altitude and whether the ISS is in daylight or in the earth's shadow. 

Built using Typescript and relying on ["Where the ISS at?" REST API](https://www.wheretheiss.at/w/developer) and [React-Leaflet.](https://www.react-leaflet.js.org/)
